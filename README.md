##  Project Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is part of the **ALX Professional Developer Program**. The main goal is to design and build a full-stack web application inspired by **Airbnb**, focusing on both frontend and backend development.

The project will cover:

* Project planning and team collaboration
* Backend API development and database management
* Frontend design and user experience
* API security and authentication
* Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

---

## Team Roles

To ensure smooth collaboration, each team member will take on a specific role.

* **Frontend Developer**: Builds the user interface, ensures responsive design, and integrates with backend APIs.
* **Backend Developer**: Implements the core business logic, creates APIs, and manages server-side operations.
* **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Designs and manages the database, ensuring data integrity and efficient queries.
* **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up deployment pipelines, manages CI/CD workflows, and ensures scalability.
* **Project Manager**: Oversees project progress, coordinates communication, and ensures deadlines are met.
* **QA Engineer**: Tests features, ensures quality standards, and reports bugs for resolution.

---

## Technology Stack

The project leverages modern tools and frameworks to ensure performance and scalability:

* **Django** – A Python-based web framework for building RESTful APIs and backend logic.
* **PostgreSQL** – A relational database to store and manage structured data (users, bookings, listings, etc.).
* **GraphQL** – Provides flexible queries and efficient communication between frontend and backend.
* **React (or Next.js)** – Builds a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* **Docker** – Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
* **GitHub Actions** – Automates testing, building, and deployment pipelines.

---

## Database Design

The key entities for the Airbnb Clone include:

* **Users**

  * Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
  * Relation: Users can own properties and make bookings.

* **Properties**

  * Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `owner_id`
  * Relation: A property belongs to one user (owner) but can have multiple bookings.

* **Bookings**

  * Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
  * Relation: A booking belongs to a user and a property.

* **Reviews**

  * Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  * Relation: A user can review a property, and a property can have multiple reviews.

* **Payments**

  * Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
  * Relation: Each payment is linked to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

* **User Management** – Allows users to sign up, log in, update profiles, and manage accounts.
* **Property Management** – Owners can list properties, update details, and manage availability.
* **Booking System** – Users can search, book, and manage reservations.
* **Reviews & Ratings** – Users can leave feedback on properties they have stayed at.
* **Payment Processing** – Secure handling of transactions for bookings.
* **Search & Filters** – Enables users to find properties by location, date, and price.

---

## API Security

Security is critical in protecting user data and financial transactions. Key measures include:

* **Authentication** – Secure login with JWT or OAuth to verify user identity.
* **Authorization** – Ensures users only access their own data and permissions (e.g., only owners can edit their listings).
* **Rate Limiting** – Prevents abuse of APIs and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Data Encryption** – Protects sensitive data such as passwords and payment details.
* **Secure Payments** – Uses trusted gateways to handle transactions safely.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

A **CI/CD pipeline** ensures faster development, testing, and deployment by automating workflows.

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically runs tests and code checks when new code is pushed.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Deploys tested code to staging or production environments.

**Tools:**

* **GitHub Actions** – For workflow automation (tests, builds, deployments).
* **Docker** – To containerize the application and ensure consistency across environments.
* **Heroku / Vercel / AWS** – For deployment of backend and frontend.
