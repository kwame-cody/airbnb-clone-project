  * Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `owner_id`
  * Relation: A property belongs to one user but can have multiple bookings.

* **Bookings**

  * Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
  * Relation: Bookings link users to properties.

* **Reviews**

  * Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  * Relation: A user can review multiple properties.
